    <h1>Why You Should Stop Using Apple. Also blocked because the site has some problems with apple devices.</h1>
    <p>Apple products are often seen as high-quality and user-friendly, but there are several reasons why you might want to consider switching to a different brand:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Expensive: Apple products are typically more expensive than their competitors, which can be a barrier for some users.</li>
      <li>Limited customization: Apple devices are known for their sleek and minimalist design, but this can also mean limited customization options for users who want to personalize their devices.</li>
      <li>Closed ecosystem: Apple's ecosystem is closed, which means that users are limited to using Apple's proprietary software and services. This can be frustrating for users who prefer more flexibility and choice.</li>
      <li>Planned obsolescence: Users criticize Apple for intentionally slowing down older devices through software updates, which can force users to upgrade to newer (and more expensive) models.</li>
      <li>AND: IT IS VERY MUCH HARDER TO DEVELOP THINGS FOR IOS THAN FOR OTHER OS's. ALSO FOR WEBDEVELOPMENT</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Also, they are bad, get something different. (scroll down)</p>
    <h3>if not...</h3>
